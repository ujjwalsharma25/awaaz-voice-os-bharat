## ❗ Problem Statement

India has over **300 million citizens who cannot read or write**, and every government service — ration status, pensions, PM Kisan, hospital access, scholarships — is locked behind apps and forms that assume literacy, typing ability, and a stable internet connection. When these citizens can't navigate a form themselves, they turn to local **middlemen ("dalals")** who charge ₹200–500 per form, draining crores from India's poorest families every year. On top of this, most interfaces are **English or Hindi-only**, shutting out speakers of Bhojpuri, Maithili, and other regional languages, while elderly citizens and women are routinely made to wait in queues for days, with little dignity or support.

## ✅ Our Solution

**AWAAZ is a voice-first "Voice OS"** that lets any citizen simply **speak** — in their own language or dialect — to access 12 essential government services, with **zero reading, typing, or literacy required**. The user speaks a request (e.g. *"mujhe ration nahi mila"*), an on-device AI model detects the intent and the right service instantly, and the app either reads out information, auto-fills the correct government form using the citizen's saved profile, or files a complaint — all confirmed back to them by voice and SMS. Because the AI runs **locally on a laptop via Ollama**, it works **fully offline**, so it isn't blocked by patchy rural internet, and it costs the user **₹0** at every step, cutting out the middleman entirely.

## 🚦 START HERE — Zero to Running (read this first)

Total time: ~15 minutes.

```bash
# 1. Get the code onto your laptop (pick ONE):
git clone <your-github-repo-url>        # recommended — push from your own laptop before the event
# OR unzip the file you brought on a USB drive

cd awaaz-voice-os-bharat

# 2. Install everything (backend + frontend)
npm run install:all

# 3. Install Ollama — this is what makes the AI run locally, offline, free
#    Download from https://ollama.com/download
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
ollama serve
#    (leave this running in its own terminal window)

# 4. In a NEW terminal window, from the project folder, start both servers:
npm run dev
```

**5. Open the app:** on your laptop, go to `http://localhost:5173` in the browser.

**6. Check it's using local AI (not just mock mode):** speak or type something in the app. A small badge should appear saying **"⚡ On-device AI"**. If instead you see **"🧪 Demo mode"**, it means Ollama isn't running — go back to step 3 and make sure `ollama serve` is still active in its terminal.

**7. Use your own phone as the mobile device:**
- Find your laptop's network address: open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`, look for "IPv4 Address" (looks like `192.168.1.42`)
- Edit the file `frontend/.env`, set: `VITE_API_URL=http://192.168.1.42:5000/api` (use the real IP you found)
- Restart `npm run dev`
- On your phone, connect to the **same WiFi** as your laptop, open a browser, go to `http://192.168.1.42:5173`

**That's it — nothing else needs to be installed or configured.** MongoDB, Twilio, and cloud AI are all optional and the app works fully without them (see below if you want them).

## 🧩 Architecture

AWAAZ splits its intelligence across a simple two-part setup:

| Component | Role | What runs there |
|---|---|---|
| 📱 **Mobile device** | Voice capture + citizen interaction | Web Speech API mic input, TTS voice replies in the citizen's own language. Sends only the raw transcript onward — no heavy compute here. |
| 💻 **Laptop ** | On-device AI brain (edge) | Local LLM via **Ollama**, running locally on the laptop. Does intent detection, form auto-fill, and voice-reply generation — **fully offline**, no internet needed. This is the primary path for every request. |
```
Citizen speaks (mobile)
        │  transcript only
        ▼
Laptop (Dell) ── local Ollama model ──▶ intent + form + voice reply
        │  low confidence / laptop offline only
        ▼
Cloud fallback (opt-in)
```

Every processed request stores **which device captured it** (`sourceDevice`) and **which tier computed the intent** (`aiComputeMode`) — see `backend/models/ServiceRequest.js` — so this is verifiable in the demo, not just claimed in a slide.

> 💰 **Zero-cost by default.** `ENABLE_CLOUD_FALLBACK=false` out of the box — the app never calls any external/paid API unless you turn it on yourself. Ollama (edge AI), MongoDB Atlas free tier, and Twilio SMS are all optional and default to free/mock modes. See "API Keys Setup" below for what each toggle actually does.

## 🗣️ Voice & Language System

- **22 official Indian languages** (8th Schedule) + Bhojpuri + English are selectable on the login screen.
- **18 of these have complete, hand-written UI translations** (text + voice) covering every screen: Hindi, English, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati, Bhojpuri, Assamese, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Odia, Urdu, Maithili, Konkani, Nepali, Sanskrit.
- The remaining 6 (Bodo, Dogri, Kashmiri, Manipuri, Santali, Sindhi) are extremely low-resource languages — the app safely falls back to Hindi text/voice for these until verified native translations or Bhashini are added.
- **Voice output (`utils/tts.js`)** picks an actual installed device voice matching the selected language wherever possible (not just a language tag — many browsers ignore the tag without an explicitly matched voice). If no local voice exists for that language, it can optionally fall back to **Bhashini** cloud TTS (see below) before finally falling back to the browser's default voice.
- **Voice input (speech recognition)** also dynamically uses the selected language's code, so what you speak is recognised in that language too.
- All spoken messages go through a single sequential queue — only one plays at a time, in order, so nothing overlaps or cuts off mid-sentence.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Step 1 — Clone / Download

```bash
# If using git
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd awaaz-voice-os-bharat
```

### Step 2 — Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install everything at once
npm run install:all

# OR individually
cd backend  && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### Step 3 — Set Up the Edge AI (Laptop)

This is the core of the story — install Ollama **on your laptop** so intent detection runs locally, fully offline:

```bash
# On your laptop
# 1. Install Ollama: https://ollama.com/download
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
ollama serve            # usually starts automatically after install
```

> Without Ollama running, AWAAZ automatically escalates every request to the cloud fallback (or mock mode) — nothing breaks, but you lose the on-device/edge story for the demo.

### Step 4 — Configure Environment

**Backend** — edit `backend/.env`:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster.mongodb.net/awaaz

# Edge AI — runs locally on this laptop
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2:3b
EDGE_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.55

# Cloud escalation only
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
GROQ_MODEL=llama3-70b-8192

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid        # optional
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token       # optional
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890    # optional
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**Frontend** — edit `frontend/.env`:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# Optional — only needed for guaranteed cloud voice on languages with
# no local browser/device voice installed. See "Bhashini" below.
VITE_BHASHINI_USER_ID=
VITE_BHASHINI_API_KEY=
```

### Step 5 — Run Both Together

```bash
# From root /awaaz-voice-os-bharat folder
npm run dev
```

Or run separately:
```bash
# Terminal 1 — Backend
cd backend && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Step 6 — Open in Browser

```
Frontend → http://localhost:5173
Backend  → http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

## 🔑 API Keys Setup — everything below is OPTIONAL

The app is fully functional with **none** of these configured — Ollama is the only thing that actually gives you the "edge AI" story, and it's free/local, not a hosted API.

### Ollama (Edge AI — recommended, free & local, not a hosted API)
1. Install → https://ollama.com/download
2. `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`
3. `ollama serve`

> **Without Ollama:** App uses keyword-based mock mode — still fully functional for demo, just no on-device LLM reasoning.

### Groq API Key (cloud escalation — OFF by default, disabled unless you opt in)
1. Set `ENABLE_CLOUD_FALLBACK=true` in `backend/.env` (default is `false`)
2. Go to → https://console.groq.com → Create account → API Keys → Create Key
3. Paste in `backend/.env` as `GROQ_API_KEY`

> Groq's developer tier is free (no card required) at the time of writing. If you don't want to depend on **any** third-party API — free or paid — just leave `ENABLE_CLOUD_FALLBACK=false`. The app will never call it, and will fall back to on-device/mock mode instead.

### MongoDB Atlas (Database)
1. Go to → https://mongodb.com/atlas
2. Create free cluster → Connect → Drivers
3. Copy connection string → paste in `MONGODB_URI`

> **Without MongoDB:** App works in mock mode, no data persisted.

### Twilio SMS (Follow-up alerts)
1. Go to → https://twilio.com → Free trial
2. Get Account SID + Auth Token + Phone Number
3. Add in `.env`

> **Without Twilio:** SMS prints to console in mock mode.

### Bhashini API (Cloud Voice + Regional Dialects) — optional
Bhashini is the Government of India's free NLP/speech platform. Two separate places in the app can use it:

1. **Frontend cloud voice** (`frontend/src/utils/bhashini.js`) — real, working integration. When a selected language has no matching voice installed on the user's device/browser, the app can ask Bhashini to generate the audio instead of falling back to the wrong-sounding default voice.
   - Register → https://bhashini.gov.in/ulca/home → Profile → "View ULCA API Key"
   - Add `VITE_BHASHINI_USER_ID` and `VITE_BHASHINI_API_KEY` to `frontend/.env`
   - **Without this:** app instantly skips Bhashini (zero delay) and uses the browser's own voice — nothing breaks.

2. **Backend dialect normalisation** (`backend/services/aiService.js` → `bhashiniNormalise()`) — currently a **mock** that returns the transcript unchanged. To make this real, replace it with an actual Bhashini ASR/translation call using the same credentials above.

## 📱 How It Works — Flow

```
User speaks (any of 22 languages) — on the MOBILE device
        ↓
Web Speech API captures audio (recognised in the selected language)
        ↓
Transcript sent to the LAPTOP
        ↓
Local Ollama model detects intent + service type — OFFLINE
        ↓ (only if laptop unreachable OR confidence < threshold)
Cloud escalation (Groq stands in for this in the demo)
        ↓
User chooses: Get Info / Fill Form / Register Complaint
        ↓
(Complaint only) App asks "what's your complaint?" → user speaks/types →
        reads it back for confirmation → THEN opens the complaint form
        ↓
Form auto-filled with user profile + GPS
        ↓
Mock Govt Gateway submits request
        ↓
Voice reply confirms in user's own language (local voice → Bhashini
        cloud voice if no local voice exists → default voice)
        ↓
Twilio SMS sends reference number
        ↓
7-day follow-up until resolved
```

> Note: dialect normalisation via Bhashini in the backend pipeline (`aiService.js`) is currently a **mock** (returns transcript unchanged) unless you wire real credentials — see "Bhashini API" above. The frontend's Bhashini cloud-voice fallback is a real, working integration once configured.
